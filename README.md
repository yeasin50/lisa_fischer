My Goal is to make it work with `navigator 2`, and I think it works well 🤐


**TLDR:** My goal was just to make the page running using navigator 2, the way page changes on websites.  Views kinda messed-up because of change scaling others. This is a practice level project so that I can learn more about flutter web, and I've learned a lot from this project.

This is the first project I've started for web purposes. There are many things I did not notice like images can have format parameters etc. You can find different approaches for the same thing in this project because I was testing different approaches.

I was confused about file naming because on my last internship I was using dot naming convention and dart was also ok with that, But the current version has a different approach. Switching between fonts can change many things, and while my focus was to create just duplicate, Now I think I could redesign something.  

Also, the portfolio got some updates.

There are many things that can be done here, like using painter class with animation from some images. Also, spacing and fonts are messed-up, and I am not satisfied of current state but 🤘😅.

Thing get complicated without written plan and while I was doing internship, the middle of the Project I didn’t get enough time to finish this and others unfinished project. After 3 months  of internship, I quit to finish this and explore others new feature like navigator 2, rive etc. The best part is solving question Stack Overflow.
